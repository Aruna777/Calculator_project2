# Calculator_project2
Welcome note:

I created an exercise page for kids with 10 multiple-choice questions by extending the previous calculator (Project 1) along with square root, mod, addition, subtraction, and division operations. My application is applicable to Windows, Mac OS, and mobile phones. I completed the front end of the application(clickable buttons for the user to choose, Display a “Correct” message, and go to the next exercise automatically, Display two buttons for “Try Again” and “Skip to Next”). Also, Built an API to generate 10 exercises and their answers (each exercise should be accompanied by 2 incorrect answers and 1 correct answer).
